# Real Estate Market Analysis with Python

## üìä Project Overview

This project explores the dynamics of the real estate market through advanced data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. By integrating two datasets‚Äî**properties** and **customers**, we aim to uncover trends, relationships, and actionable insights. The analysis ranges from understanding sales patterns to customer demographics, supporting decision-making with statistical rigor.

---

## ‚ú® Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Uncover patterns in property sales and customer behavior through visualizations and statistical summaries.
3. **Key Insights and Metrics**:
   - Calculate averages, totals, and relationships to derive meaningful conclusions.
4. **Actionable Recommendations**:
   - Offer insights to stakeholders for data-driven decision-making.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

### 1. **`properties.csv`**
   - **Description**: Contains information about properties, including their features, pricing, and sale status.
   - **Key Columns**:

     - `type`: Property type (e.g., apartment, office).
     - `area`: Size in square feet.
     - `price`: Sale price (USD).
     - `sold`: Indicator if the property is sold (`1`) or unsold (`0`).
     - `date_sale`: Date of sale.

### 2. **`customers.csv`**
   - **Description**: Customer-related information such as demographics, satisfaction, and mortgage usage.
   - **Key Columns**:
     - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for customers.
     - `sex`: Gender of the customer.
     - `state`, `country`: Geographical details.
     - `deal_satisfaction`: Customer satisfaction rating (1-5).
     - `mortgage`: Whether the customer used a mortgage (`Yes`, `No`).

### üí° Derived Fields
   - **`price$`**: Converted `price` to numeric format.
   - **`age_at_purchase`**: Age of the customer at the time of property purchase.
   - **`age_interval`**: Grouped age intervals for analysis.
   - **`price_interval`**: Grouped price ranges.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Visualization.
  - `datetime`: Date-time handling.

## üìà Methodology

### 1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Renamed inconsistent columns and handled missing values (`date_sale`, `state`, `customer_id`).
   - Converted currency fields and dates to proper formats.
   - Derived new fields to facilitate analysis.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Segmented data by **country**, **state**, and **customer demographics**.
   - Visualized relationships using scatter plots, bar charts, and frequency distributions.

### 3. **Key Calculations**
   - **By Building**: Total sales, mortgage usage, and average satisfaction scores.
   - **By State**: Aggregated sales frequency and cumulative distributions.
   - **By Customer Demographics**: Age-based analysis, including intervals.
