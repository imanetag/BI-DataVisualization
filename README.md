# 📚 Data Analysis Projects Overview

Welcome to the **Data Analysis Projects Repository**! This repository contains two data analysis projects that explore different domains using statistical and machine learning techniques in R and Python. Below you will find an overview of both projects, along with the instructions on how to get started.

## 🏠 Housing Market Data Analysis - Project 1 (R)

### Project Overview
This project analyzes a housing market dataset to explore the relationships between different factors such as crime rates, average rooms, and median home values. The primary goal is to build predictive models that help in understanding housing prices based on various predictors.

**Key Features**:
- Data cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Statistical analysis (descriptive statistics, correlation analysis).
- Predictive modeling using **linear regression**.
- Data visualization using **R** libraries like `ggplot2` and `corrplot`.

For more detailed analysis, the project also includes hypothesis testing and regression diagnostics to ensure the models' validity.

**Key Columns** in the dataset:
- `Crime.Rate`: Crime rate per capita by town.
- `Average.Rooms`: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- `Median.Home.Value`: Median value of homes in $1000s.
  
### Folder Structure
- The **housing_market_analysis** folder contains the R scripts, dataset, and any additional files for the analysis.
- You will find a detailed `README.md` inside the project folder for instructions specific to this analysis.

## 🏢 Real Estate Market Analysis - Project 2 (Python)

### Project Overview
This project focuses on the real estate market, analyzing datasets related to property sales, customer demographics, and mortgage information. The goal is to derive insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and property pricing based on various features like location, property type, and customer satisfaction.

**Key Features**:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- Statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing and correlation.
- Advanced visualizations to highlight key findings.
  
**Key Columns** in the dataset:
- `property_id`: Unique identifier for each property.
- `type`: Type of the property (e.g., apartment, office).
- `price`: Sale price of the property.
- `sold`: Whether the property is sold or unsold.
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.

### Folder Structure
- The **real_estate_analysis** folder contains the Python scripts, dataset, and additional documentation related to this project.
- A detailed `README.md` is also available within this folder for further instructions.
